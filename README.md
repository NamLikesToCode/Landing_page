Project Title
-My first landing page, created with HTML, CSS and flexbox!

Prerequisites
Basic HTML, CSS and Flexbox

Built With
VScode- Editor
Github -Repository

What I learned:
It is important to read a lot of code, I contribute my success to this project by rereading documentations (flex) for past lessons, and reading html code over and over again to undestand the layout. Past lessons helped a lot. 

Most difficult part:
Writing the layout and classes. 
Making well named classes is important. I've caught myself tripping on my own code sometimes.
